             * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the 
               tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
 
             * Example 1:

               Input: [1,2,3]

                    1
                   / \
                  2   3

               Output: 6

               Example 2:

               Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

                 -10
                  / \
